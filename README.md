Very basic flutter project with firebase and flutter redux.

You can see the project running at: https://flutter-test-b6905.web.app/#login

## Getting Started

The project is missing the `firebase_options.dart` file, follow the [steps](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup?platform=ios) to recreate the file and run the project with your own instance.
